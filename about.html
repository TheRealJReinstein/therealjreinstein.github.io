                            <h4>This website was created by me, Julian, a University of Pittsburgh student with apparently way too much time on his hands. Like, WAY too much time. We're talking countless hours of sorting, cataloging, and coding.</h4>
                            <br>
                            <h4>I started collecting baseball cards around 2013. About 75% of my collection is from both the junk wax era (a period roughly between 1986 and 1993 when card companies overproduced low-value cards) and 2013-2019, when I purchased/was gifted Topps packs every year. My favorite teams growing up were the San Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics; so, unsurprisingly, over a fifth of my collection is Padres and A's cards.</h4>
                            <br>
                            <h4>However, they aren't all just some mass-produced rectangular pieces of cardboard. There are some cool-ish cards. Some even have stories. Like how my grandmother gifted me three different Tony Gwynn rookies. Or the random 1976 Topps Hank Aaron I found while sorting. And how Gaylord Perry himself handed me an autographed card at the 2016 MLB All-Star FanFest in San Diego.</h4>
                            <br>
                            <h4>3,997 is the final count. This is subject to change, as I'll inevitably collect more cards and keep updating this website. Each list is sorted by year.</h4>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Throughout your adventure, you'll find hundreds of players you've probably never heard of and whose cards are only worth about half of a cent--hey, that's the name of the website!</h4></h4>
